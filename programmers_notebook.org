*** GHC Internals
**** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9pxo7L8mS0][An Intuition for List Folds by Tony Morris (video)]]
In this presentation Tony gives a simple intuition to understanding both left and right folds of lists. Left fold as a loop over a collection, right fold as replacement for cons and nil.
**** [[http://takenobu-hs.github.io/downloads/haskell_ghc_illustrated.pdf][GHC(STG,Cmm,asm) illustrated]]                             :ghc:internals:
This is gold! Massive, constantly updated presentation about memory layout, memory alloation, Core, STG, Cmm and assembly. This is a go to document when trying to understand how GHC works under the hood.
**** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t6wt7ByBWg][Edsko de Vries - Being lazy without being bloated]]        :ghc:internals:
In this talk Edsko is showing his tool NoThunk that allows to narrow down thunks that could potentially cause memory leaks. It is also a good introduction for anyone willing to understand how memory leaks can occur in GHC.
**** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLDerKtUWE][Maxim Koltsov â€“ Introduction to Haskell execution and garbage collection internals]] :ghc:internals:
Nice introduction to memory allocation, garbage collection in GHC

Nice writ-upabout events produced by GHC and how one can use them to find problematic places in their code

This should become part of my org-hydra so I don't have to come back to this hack.
